<p id="h">Dear Guest:

    Thank you for stopping by the Bird in Hand Family Restaurant & Smorgasbord.  From the moment you arrive and are greeted with a smile by our Staff,  they will work diligently to provide you with the best dining experience possible.
    
    We offer you a choice of either menu dining or our famous smorgasbords at all three meals of the day. You’ll taste the difference as we’re committed to serving farm-fresh, local foods.  Most of our dishes are made from scratch and many are passed down from the Smucker family recipes. Our entire staff works hard at providing you with the quality of food that Bird-in-Hand Family Restaurant has been known for over the past 45 years.
    
    We are extremely  proud of our reputation for exceptional service and fresh, wholesome food which brings many of our guests back to us time and again.  Ask any of our local and frequent diners and they will tell you we are a place where they can get a home-cooked meal and feel like family.  Oh, and don’t forget our Noah Ark’s kids’ buffet featuring lots of kid-friendly foods, served from a buffet built by a local Amish craftsman.  They will love it!
    
    We strive to exceed our commitment to you, our Guest, and look forward to you dining with us soon!</p>
